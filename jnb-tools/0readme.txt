These examples are developed for reading information from a `*.dpp` file and generate useful plots.

[Warning] Note that these notebooks read local modules from the `local_modules` directory.  Therefore if you decide the directory structure, please keep in mind that some local modules are read from this folder and therefore you should also make necessary changes.
