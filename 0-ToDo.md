- [x] test excel output functions
- [ ] self.mask should be defined clearly whether for cake or original data.  for speed it should be better for cake.  then later when mask file from dioptas is read, which is for original image, it can be confusing.  But intensity mask can be still maintained for cake, not for original.  The decision depends on whether sectional integration is happening for existing cake or for original image file.

- [x] Brain storm with CODEX on transitioning from dpp to human readable forms.  Long arrays, such as 1D XRD related files in chi and 2D cake in npy, should be saved separately.  For all other information, it should be saved in a form which can be expandable with future development.  Basically all the information in DPP should be moved to this, so that the information can be brought back when needed.  Plan is to replace dpp with this new form of data saving.  Consider utilizing PARAM folder which I have been using to save json files, chi and cake files.  If there are better forms, please suggest.  If Dpp exists, read and then convert to json's and then archive to PARAM folder. Only open button.  When Chi opens, all in PARAM opens. Backup PARAM for only changed file and develop logic to restore old PARAMS combined unchanged ones.
